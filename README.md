# Q-Example-Creating-a-Qubit-Superposition-and-Measuring-It
This Q# code demonstrates the basic operations of initializing a qubit, applying a Hadamard gate to put it into a superposition state, measuring its value, and then resetting it. This example illustrates how to work with qubits in Q# and perform fundamental quantum operations.
